-- These are questions asked in UBer BA role as per the post https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7306150836819148801/
-- Q1. Write an SQL query to extract the third transaction of every user, displaying user ID, spend, and transaction date.

WITH RankedTransactions AS (
    SELECT user_id, transaction_amount AS spend, transaction_date,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS txn_rank
    FROM transactions
)
SELECT user_id, spend, transaction_date
FROM RankedTransactions
WHERE txn_rank = 3;


-- Q2.Calculate the average ratings for each driver across different cities using data from rides and ratings tables.
SELECT r.driver_id, r.city, AVG(rt.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM rides r
JOIN ratings rt ON r.ride_id = rt.ride_id
GROUP BY r.driver_id, r.city;

-- Q3  Create an SQL query to identify customers registered with Gmail addresses from the 'users' database.
SELECT user_id, username, email
FROM users
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';


-- Q4. What is database denormalization
/*
Denormalization is the **process of introducing redundancy** into a **normalized database** to improve **read performance** at the cost of **increased storage** and **potential data inconsistencies**.

---

### **Key Points:**
âœ… **Trade-off Between Speed & Storage:** It **reduces JOINs** by storing redundant data, making queries faster.  
âœ… **Common in OLAP (Analytical) Systems:** Used in **data warehouses** where read performance is more important than write efficiency.  
âœ… **Increases Redundancy:** Some data is **stored multiple times** to speed up access.  
âœ… **Risk of Data Inconsistencies:** Requires careful handling of **updates and deletions**.

---

### **Example:**
#### **Normalized (3rd Normal Form) - Separate Tables**
| Order_ID | Customer_ID | Product_ID |  
|----------|------------|------------|  
| 101      | 1          | P001       |  
| 102      | 2          | P002       |  

| Customer_ID | Customer_Name |  
|------------|--------------|  
| 1          | Alice        |  
| 2          | Bob          |  

ðŸ”¹ **Requires a JOIN** to get the customer name in an order query.

#### **Denormalized - Combined Data**
| Order_ID | Customer_Name | Product_ID |  
|----------|--------------|------------|  
| 101      | Alice        | P001       |  
| 102      | Bob          | P002       |  

ðŸ”¹ **Faster queries, but redundant `Customer_Name` values.**

---

### **When to Use Denormalization?**
- **For faster read-heavy queries (OLAP, Reporting, Analytics).**
- **To reduce expensive JOIN operations.**
- **When performance is prioritized over storage efficiency.**

-- Q5. Analyze the click-through conversion rates using data from ad_clicks and cab_bookings tables.

WITH Clicks AS (

-- Q6. Define a self-join and provide a scenario for its application.
-- Employees who are earning more than their managers. 
    
-- Scenario-Based Question:
-- Q1. What is the probability that at least two of three recommended routes for drivers are the fastest, given a 70% success rate?
    -- Need to use Binomial theorm here. 

-- Guesstimate Questions:
-- Q1. Estimate the number of Uber drivers in Delhi.
/*
Step 1: Estimate the Population of Delhi
Delhi has a population of ~30 million people.
Step 2: Estimate the Number of People Who Use Uber
Not everyone uses Uber. Letâ€™s assume:
60% of people are adults (18M).
50% of adults can afford Uber â†’ 9M potential users.
Assume 30% of them use Uber regularly â†’ ~3M regular users.
Step 3: Estimate the Number of Daily Rides
Assume each regular user takes 10 rides per month on average.
Monthly rides = 3M Ã— 10 = 30M rides per month.
Daily rides = 30M / 30 = 1M rides per day.
Step 4: Estimate the Number of Active Uber Drivers
A driver completes ~10 rides per day on average.
Total drivers needed = 1M rides / 10 rides per driver = 100,000 drivers.
Final Estimate:
Delhi has approximately 100,000 Uber drivers.
(This is a rough estimate and can vary based on ride demand, part-time vs full-time drivers, and surge periods.)

-- Q2. How many Uber cabs leave Bengaluru Airport in a day?

/*
Guesstimate: Number of Uber Cabs Leaving Bengaluru Airport Daily
We will use a top-down approach, breaking it into logical steps.

Step 1: Estimate Daily Passenger Traffic at Bengaluru Airport
Bengaluruâ€™s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) is one of the busiest in India.
Assume ~300,000 passengers travel daily (both arrivals & departures).
Step 2: Estimate Arriving Passengers
Assuming a 50-50 split, around 150,000 passengers arrive daily.
Step 3: Estimate the Percentage Using Uber
Not all arriving passengers take an Uber. Letâ€™s break it down:
30% are picked up by family/friends â†’ ~45,000.
20% take other transport (buses, metro, rentals, etc.) â†’ ~30,000.
50% use taxis, including Uber/Ola â†’ ~75,000 passengers.
Step 4: Estimate the Share of Uber in Taxi Market
Assume Uber has a 60% market share among taxis.
Number of Uber passengers = 75,000 Ã— 60% = 45,000.
Step 5: Estimate Uber Occupancy Per Ride
Assume an average of 1.5 passengers per Uber ride.
Total Uber rides needed = 45,000 / 1.5 â‰ˆ 30,000 Uber trips.
Final Estimate:
Around 30,000 Uber cabs leave Bengaluru Airport per day.
(This can vary based on flight schedules, peak hours, and special events.)
